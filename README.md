_This was an exercise in writing data structures for Life, and as a whole is unfinished, and for now, quiescent. I may return to it, but for now it is not useful for what I am trying to achieve in Rust._

A Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life, under development and some way off being useful.

The approach is to support an infinite playfield, using sparse arrays of sparse arrays.

This has been a vehicle for my journey of learning Rust, so expect variability in the quality of the code.
